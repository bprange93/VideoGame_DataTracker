Visualize the Data in Charts
	-Chart.js stacked bar chart (https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/charts/bar/stacked.html)
	-each bar represents a game's total sales, section of bar represents sales by region (us, us, jp, other)

Which video game console is best to invest in based on number of game copies sold globally
	-basic: chart grouped by console showing total game copies sold
	-for each game that runs on that console, add to total game copies sold on that console (create model for this?)
	-could also target/break this down by region
	-could weight this by region - how much of global sales do that region's sales account for?

Sample Evaluation Question
	-How should our investment projections change if we anticipate a 25% increase in a region's sales for next year?



Proposed Workflow:
	-search for a game and see its details (Story 6)
	-see a data visualization of the number of copies sold per console (Story 5)
	-visualize the API data in the form of line graphs or charts (Story 4)
	-see which video game console is best to invest in
	-write/visualize sample evaluation question
	-clean up UI
	-bonus
